\section{Outline}
An app for collecting and visualizing data. Users can create \textbf{collections}, which are collections of data that goes together (e.g. amount a plant grows over time, how much water someone drinks each day, weight over time, etc). The user then inputs new \textbf{entries}. You can visualize each collection through graphs between any two items on each entry.

\subsection{Screens}
Home/select collection screen, create collection, edit collection, add item, edit item, view items, visualize items, settings(?)

\section{things to remember}
each item has to have the date recorded auto-added when it's added by the user, so users can see when it was added automatically and view additions over time always.
